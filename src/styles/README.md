# Styles

We are using [`@ledgerhq/react-ui`](https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-live/tree/develop/libs/ui/packages/react) for our UI.

### Registry

The `registry` file is a utility component that helps collecting all CSS rules in a render. Read more [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/styling/css-in-js#styled-components).

### Provider

The `provider` file exports a single `StyleProvider` wrapper that loads everything needed to work with `styled-components` and our own UI library.
